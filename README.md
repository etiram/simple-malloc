# myMalloc
### A EPITA practical on recoding malloc

The purpose of this practical was to implement a simple version of malloc() and the affiliated functions (free, calloc and realloc).

Of course this version is a lot less powerfull than most malloc (such as those used by Firefox or Chrome for example) but it helps figure out how exactly this function is supposed to work.
