# myMalloc
## A practical on recoding malloc

As part of my studies at Epita, I've been asked to code my own malloc function.

Of course this version is a lot less powerfull than most malloc used by Firefox or Chrome for example but it allowed me to understand how exactly this function is supposed to work.
